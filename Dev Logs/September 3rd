Last night I had mulled over the idea to create a MVP before attempting the full fledged champion select reinforcement
learning AI program.

MVP: Website where the user can guess which team composition has won with a login system and leaderboard.

Stage 2: Utilize a neural network model (likely RNN & Transformers) to predict winners based on team composition

Stage 3: Data pipeline for new match data

Stage 4: Reinforcement learning champion select agent

Main Tasks:

Get Champion Images - Done

Wrangle Match Data - Done

What we want from dataset:

match_matchId
player_teamId
player_teamPosition
player_lane
player_champName
player_banPickTurn
player_champName_ban
player_win


Next Set of Tasks:

Create the guessing game using match data

Store Bundled matches in a database.

link champion images to picks/bans 






Ideas:
Create skill brackets for ranking on leaderboard (Challenger, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on % dist
