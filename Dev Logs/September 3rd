Last night I had mulled over the idea to create a MVP before attempting the full fledged champion select reinforcement
learning AI program.

MVP: Website where the user can guess which team composition has won with a login system and leaderboard.

Stage 2: Utilize a neural network model (likely RNN & Transformers) to predict winners based on team composition

Stage 3: Data pipeline for new match data

Stage 4: Reinforcement learning champion select agent

Main Tasks:
Get Champion Images
Wrangle Match Data


Ideas:
Create skill brackets for ranking on leaderboard (Challenger, Diamond, Platinum, Gold, Silver, Bronze) based on % dist
