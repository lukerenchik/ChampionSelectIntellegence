Big Win Today!!!

Champions are being displayed in the HTML, I have linked the Champion portraits to the naming so those are displayed
on the website as well. There is no longer a bug with not refreshing properly after selecting a winner.

Next Steps: Implement a user system with registration & login, then create a leaderboard to track those with the
best ratio of correct guesses.
