Main Objectives:

    Update Website every time a winner is selected

    Backend Functions for tracking correct/incorrect answers and what bundles have already been seen

        - Backend functions are implemented but cannot be tested due to lingering error related to displaying and fetching
          match data.


At this point instead of continuing to add more code, I think it will be valuable to perform a great refactoring effort
to increase code robustness, reduce clutter, and to generally create a better foundation for the program.

Tables:

MatchData:
5 Thousand Matches Ready to be Served with the following features

features = [
    'match_matchId', 'player_teamId', 'player_teamPosition',
    'player_lane', 'player_champName', 'player_banPickTurn',
    'player_champName_ban', 'player_win'
]

Users:
All registered Users

features = ['user_id', 'password', 'correct_answers' (int) , 'incorrect_answers' (int) , 'matches_seen' (a list of match_matchId)

MatchLoader has been updated to be a more generic dataloader for the MatchGuesser, the class can be initialized with
a filepath to a dataset of matches which will then be added to the matches table of the database.

I need to seperate the many different pages from the index html file and create a seperate css standard for the website.

Login Page
Registration Page
Match Guesser Page


Files that still need updates:
