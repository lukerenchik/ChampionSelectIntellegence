Main Objective:

Seperate & Update HTML Code

Code is seperated and updated to utilize SQLAlchemy client, but I am now running into a Network Error when attempting to
post registration to the database.

TODO: Eventually add a template engine, css styling, etc, to streamline html and make the website look good.

Well tough day...
I suppose these happen, developing is a challenging endeavour, and I am branching into a new space (web dev) from the
comfort of mathematics and algorithms.

I have tested and verified that I have a CORS issue with my browser that is causing my registrations to not post,
after numerous attempted fixes I let that problem sit and attempted to access the api's through CURL. This came with
its own set of challenges as the SQLAlchemy instance I am using is not being initialized properly (or something of
that nature) I spent limited resources attempting to solve this problem so it will be where I start tomorrow.

BIG OBJECTIVES TO SOLVE:

CORS Communication Issues (Frontend<->Backend)

SQLAlchemy Initialization & Setup
