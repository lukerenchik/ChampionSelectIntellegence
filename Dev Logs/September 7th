BIG OBJECTIVES TO SOLVE:

CORS Communication Issues (Frontend<->Backend)

SQLAlchemy Initialization & Setup

------------------------------------------------

Match Loader setup & working! Database now is loaded with all of the matches!!!

(Guster - Ganging up on the Sun) is an incredible album, it is making debugging a big time vibe.

------------------------------------------------

Successes : Match loader is working and should be adaptable to any database schema.

Challenges : Need to understand a database toolchain and implement effectively, SQLAlchemy is causing more issues
than it is fixing, now I am considering using MongoDB or some other online noSQL database to house my information.
