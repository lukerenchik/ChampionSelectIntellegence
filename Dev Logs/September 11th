Fixed databases to have correct data types

Updated Matchloader class

MatchFetcher successfully returned random matches from the database.

I am getting the data to the website in a package, I can see it in the console, I can't get it to display in the HTML.

I think I need to deep dive into HTML to understand why this is happening.
